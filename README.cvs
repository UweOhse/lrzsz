You can access the lrzsz sources through CVS, using something like
	export CVSROOT=:pserver:cvsread@tirka.ohse.de:/var/cvs-pub 
	cvs login
		use `cvsread' as password
	cvs checkout lrzsz

But you'll need the same automake version as i use (use finger to 
find which one i'm using at the moment: 
	finger uwe-tool-versions@tirka.ohse.de
). The same might be true für autoconf and gettext.
Automake _will_ be run because CVS garbles the timestamp of the files
it checks out. You'll have to live with that.

Tar archives and diffs of the cvs trees and are also available. See 
	ftp://tirka.ohse.de/uwe/cvs-trees
They share the same problems, though.
