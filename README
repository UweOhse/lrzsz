NOTE:

Do not use the repository until further notice.
It contains work in progress and at least one change i am unhappy with.

Use either http://ohse.de/uwe/testing/lrzsz-0.12.21rc.tar.gz (over 20
years in rc state, so it's good enough), or 0.12.20 from 
https://ohse.de/uwe/software/lrzsz.html (do not expect me to update 
that old site ever again).

********************

Future plans:

- remove all traces of K&R C

- kill many #if(def) 

- remove everything unused.
-- gettext (no translations in 20 years, and the po dir is a mess)
-- lrzszbug

- rewrite the mess, maybe in go.

- add the protocol debugger, if i find it again (it may have been lost 
  in time).

- switch from alarm() to select.

- cleanup the test suite

- do something about the getopt mess (gnulib wants 7 files...)

- is the usage of vasprintf really needed?

- go through the logging and assign severities following some rule.
  it wasn't good before the cleanup started, but now the severities are
  noticable bad.

- split the sender in three programs.

- protocol extensions?
---- higher resolution timestamps (if i keep me release cycle, then
     y2038 will come before the next major release).
---- large file support (no, i don't want to send whole disks with
     zmodem, but maybe some videos).

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

lrzsz is a X/Y/ZModem package built from the public-domain version of
Chuck Forsberg´s rzsz package. This package contains NO code from later
releases of rzsz which would preclude it from being released under the
GPL.
It has been heavily modified by me and others.

Please note that credit should be given to Chuck Forsberg (rzsz) and Stephen
Satchell/Satchell Evaluations (crc routines) for this package. Any later
modifications were minor and merely introduced to increase performance,
reliability or compatability.

There is a mailing list for lrzsz: <uwe-lrzsz@bulkmail.ohse.de>. 
To subscribe send a mail to <uwe-lrzsz-subscribe@bulkmail.ohse.de>.

I prefer to get bug reports sent using the `lrzszbug' shell script which
you can find in the `src' subdirectory (this script is not installed together
with the programs because i don't expect many bug reports). Nethertheless
you can still send bug reports to <bugs@bulkmail.ohse.de> as normal
electronic mails. Bugs received at this address may be forwarded to the
mailing list.
