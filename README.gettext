In case you see a dump of your environment after running configure
or config.status you might want to either:
- downgrade to gettext-0.10.32 (maybe 33 or 34 will work too, but
  i didn' test them)
- upgrade to a newer autoconf version (there is none at the moment
  of this writing - Oct 1998 - and i suspect this state will not
  change soon)
- patch your /usr/lib/acgeneral.m4 (see below).
In any case you should rerun "aclocal" afterwards and 
"configure" again.

Sorry for the trouble.
--------------------------------------------------------------------

This little patch solves a problem i found using gettext-0.10.35.
For some reason AM_GNU_GETTEXT (serial 5) calls 
AC_LINK_FILES($nls_cv_header_libgt, $nls_cv_header_intl)
with both variables being empty (at least on my redhat-5.1 
system).
This gives an config.status script like this one:
	ac_sources=" "
	ac_dests=" "

	srcdir=$ac_given_srcdir
	while test -n "$ac_sources"; do
	  set $ac_dests; ac_dest=$1; shift; ac_dests=$*
	  set $ac_sources; ac_source=$1; shift; ac_sources=$*

"set ; ac_source=$1; shift; ac_sources=$*" produces some not
so nice looking output ...

I think the right fix is something like that, but maybe Ulrich might want
to try something else since autoconf seems to be basically unmaintained.

don't forget to rebuild your frozen m4 files:
	cd /usr/lib/autoconf
	m4 -F autoconf.m4f autoconf.m4
	m4 -F autoheader.m4f autoheader.m4

Well, i sent this to the gettext maintainer some months 
ago, but never got an answer ....
