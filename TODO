- make argv[0]-recognition of X/YModem work with program_name_transform.
- look into VMIN code: how to determine if it's usable (it isn't unter
  FreeBSD and NetBSD (might have changed) and possibly many other 
  system), and what is the max value?
  Anyway - we don't *need* it. It just reduces system load (but that's
  not a real problem - zmodem over a ISDN/modem link is not much load).
- provide a way to not use any CRC check (for those people who
  a) think that lrzsz is to slow for their serial lines, or b) think
  that their transmission lines are safe. Oh well, some people don't
  learn without having pain).
- improve error reporting.
- clean up Output in verbose mode. (document what's printed if
  verbose is `n')
