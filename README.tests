From "ease of use" onwards:

"make fastcheck"
	will do a simple self check, sending lsz, lrz, lsz.c and lrz.c
	over a named pipe. 
	This test just covers basic zmodem functionality, and it's
	the only one which will work under BeOS: All other tests
	need "real" named pipes, /pipe under BeOS simply hasn't
	the right semantics.

"make vcheck" and "make oldcheck-local"
	will do a fast check of the most important features.
	"vcheck" gives some more output, especially CPS-rates.

"make check"
	will do a _long_ regression test.
	Some tests need special programs (omen.sz, omen.rz, zmtx, zmrx).
	Some might only work on my system.
	In any case you'll need dejagnu for this.
