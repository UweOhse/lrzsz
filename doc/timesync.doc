ZMODEM Time Synchronization
---------------------------

PD Zmodem enhances the Zmodem standard by the feature of synchronizing
the receiver's system clock to the sender's clock. To accomplish this,
PD-Zmodem introduces a new ZRINIT flag:

#define TIMESYNC 01000      /* Receiver requests time synchronization */

When the sender detects this flag, it sends a file named "$time$.t"
with its system date as file date and the difference between local
time and UTC as file contents. The file need not to be transmitted
at once, but it may be inserted at any point during a batch transfer.
Though, the file's time must be determined as shortly before the
transmission as possible, and only one "$time$.t" file may be sent
during one Zmodem batch.

The UTC offset is calculated in minutes. If the local time is four
hours and 30 minutes before UTC, the time offset is -(4*60+30) =
-270. The time offset is stored in the file as a decimal string with
a trailing CR+LF. If the sender doesn't know its time zone, the file
must be empty (zero bytes length).

It is recommended to implement time synchonization as an option. The
receiver should request time synchronization only if the option is
enabled. If the receiver requests time synchronization but the sender
did not enable it, the request should be ignored. If the receiver did
not request time synchronization and receives a file named "$time$.t",
then it should be treated as a normal file.

It is up to the implementation if a real file "$time$.t" is created
on either side, or if it is handled as a virtual file.

The way of transferring a file instead of a new header for time syn-
chronization was chosen for two reasons: It can be implemented without
crucial changes to the Zmodem protocol, and it doesn't need much of
additional error handling.


NOTE: The current PD-Zmodem version does not support the Time-Zone
      feature but always sends empty "$time$.t" files.
