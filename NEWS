Version 0.12.20 - December 1998, Uwe Ohse

* works on BeOS and stone-aged SCO (sco-3.2v4.2)

* pubdir-"feature" works again.

* "make rpm" creates a rpm file.

* "optimal blklen calculation" was too aggressive, it
  now does nothing if the user demands fixed blklens.

* various smaller and medium bug fixes.

* a more or less important security bug is fixed (stupid 
  use of /tmp in a piece of code which is rarely used).

* lrz uses umask to make files unreadable which receiving
  them.

* "sh systype | mail uwe-generic-counter@ohse.de"
  sends a success report with a description of the
  system type.

* --enable-syslog is now default

Version 0.12.19 - January 1998, Uwe Ohse

* 0.12.18 was broken, lsz crashed if receiver found an CRC error.

* lrz options "--rename" and "--escape" didn't work.

* lrz didn't implement senders "overwrite-or-skip" option.

* added dejagnu testsuite. Maybe you need a dejagnu snapshot to
  use it.

Version 0.12.18 - November 1997, Uwe Ohse

* syslog output now includes user name.

* new script lrzszbug, to be used for bugreports (untested)

* lots of compiler warnings (egcs -Wparanoia [many -W]) removed.

* new options --tcp-server and --tcp-client ADDRESS:PORT for
  both programs.

Version 0.12.17 - August 1997, Uwe Ohse

* internal cleanup.

* portability enhancements by (Philippe De Muyter <phdm@info.ucl.ac.be>)

* lsz has a new option "--tcp" (no shortopt implemented). lsz transmits
  one file over normal stdin/stdout (a control file), then opens a
  tcp connection to transmit all other files. [this should help you,
  Peter]
  That _might_ be useful if your telnetd is really stupid.

  (was _not_put on ftp/http server)

Version 0.12.16 - March 1997, Uwe Ohse

* major performance improvement (less CPU time needed - don't expect
  faster transfers over slow lines). `make vcheck' now show about 50%
  more throughput.

* updated to gettext-0.12.27 and automake-1.1l
  (automake-1.1l bug: AC_SUBST in AM_PATH_PROG_WITH_TEST leads
  to a "$1=@$1@" line in Makefile.in. I hacked around it in
  /usr/share/aclocal/gettext.m4)

* minor bug fix.

Version 0.12.15 - Februar 1997, Uwe Ohse

* should now compile with pre-ANSI-compilers (tested with HPUX
  bundled compiler - what a bad program. shame on HP).

* new option --o-sync for lrz, open output file in synchronous write
  mode (for those poor systems losing interrupts if update locks
  interrupts too long).

Version 0.12.14 - Januar 1997, Uwe Ohse

* compiles cleaner on SCO, HPUX (even with the native compiler).

* improved error reporting (i think there are still possibilities for
  further improvements, if anybody case spare time :-)).

Version 0.12.13 - Januar 1997, Uwe Ohse

* no user visible changes

Version 0.12.12 - December 1996, Uwe Ohse

* lrx and lrb (aka lsz --x/ymodem) now default to 128 byte
  block length (to fix interoperatability problems with
  some Xmodems [USR courier flash upload]).

* lrz didn't recognize every short option.

* minor performance tweaks.

* replace mktime() if needed.

* updated to autoconf 2.12.

Version 0.12.11 - October 1996, Uwe Ohse

* lrzsz now has a home page, http://www.csl-gmbh.net/~uwe/lrzsz.html.
  it still needs some work (oh well, it's "under construction" :-).

* lsz/lrz recognize "rshell" as another name for the restricted
  shell.

* new option --stop-at HH:MM (stop transmission at HH:MM), and
  --stop-at +N (stop in N seconds).

* don't hang on BSD machines after getting a timeout (SIGALRM).
  Stupid BSD people ...

* rb (Y-Modem receive): read at max 1000 bytes after getting a
  bad header, before giving up.

* new option --delay-startup N: wait N seconds before doing 
  anything (debugging aid).

* Interrupt signal handling turned on under linux (i still don't 
  know why it was turned off).

* better handling of "sz -", by Philippe De Muyter.


Version 0.12.10 - September 1996, Uwe Ohse

* lsz resends init string if it doesn't receive rz's init.

* improved "make check". (Philippe De Muyter <phdm@info.ucl.ac.be>)

* `sz -' should work again (but i cannot test it). Anyway, this will not
  work if sz cannot read from stdout.

* portability enhancements by (Philippe De Muyter <phdm@info.ucl.ac.be>)


Version 0.12.9 - September 1996, Uwe Ohse

* new options --min-bps N and --min-bps-time M: If BPS rate falls under N
  for at least M seconds (default: 120) transmission will be stopped.

* added some missing error messages.

* updated manual pages.


Version 0.12.8 - August 1996, Uwe Ohse

* bug fixes.

* sz and rz now know about a new option:
  -E, --rename: change name if target exists.

* new option -T, --turbo for sz: sz doesn't escape 4 special characters
  if this option is given (this should not make problems with any 
  rz, but could be problematic on certain links where this characters
  have to be escaped).

* debugged blocksize calculation.

* -+, --append option fixed.


Version 0.12.7 - August 1996, Uwe Ohse

* portability enhancements. compiles and runs under hurd.


Version 0.12.6 - August 1996, Uwe Ohse

* some portability enhancements (phdm@info.ucl.ac.be)
* sz and rz now have a new option -B NNN. NNN stands for the
  size of the disk buffer to use (in Bytes). NNN == auto buffers
  the whole file. Use it if you get crc errors while accessing
  the disk.


Version 0.12.5 - August 1996, Uwe Ohse

* some portability enhancements (getopt.c)
* install creates symlinks from l[rs]z to l[rs][bx]


Version 0.12.4 - June 1996, Uwe Ohse

* some bug fixes

* `rz -r' should now really work

* `make check' and `make vcheck' now try to check crash recovery


Version 0.12.3 - June 1996, Uwe Ohse

* just a few bugfixes.


Version 0.12.2 - June 1996, by Uwe Ohse

* German translation

* internationalized

* went away from flat directory structure

* added termios support

* added syslog support

* turned to automake

* lrz want give received files execution permission if running under
  rsh.


New in lrzsz-0.12b:

- lrz: remote command execution is disabled per default. This 
  fixes a major security hole.
- lrz now defaults to restricted mode.
- lrz has a more restricted mode in which creation of directories
  and invisible files is not allowed. See lrz.1 for more information.
- rz and sz now recognize x- or y-modem-mode even if named lsb or lsx 
  (instead of sb or sx).
- timeout code is enabled again, can be turned of with the -O option.
- PUBDIR is now optional. configure with --enable-pubdir=/path if you
  really want a public writeable directory (i don't, so the default
  is no such directory).
- turned to GNU autoconf.
- added timesync protocol extension by Peter Mandrella. See timesync.doc
  and the man pages for more information.
- added crash recovery (this is a really simple extension to the 
  receivers file opening code). Both lrz and lsz no have a -r switch
  to request resume of a former transfer.
- many major and minor performance hacks.
- new: 8K blocksize (a common extension in the DOS world). Turn on
  with the -8 option to lsz (lrz handles this automatically).
